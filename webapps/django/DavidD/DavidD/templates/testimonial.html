			Dave is totally committed to his students and to providing dedicated, focused 	instruction on drumming technique.  He has the really unique skill of being able to 	explain mechanical technique in an easily understandable way and on top of it, 	he takes the time to make sure you're progressing from lesson to lesson and 	offers nothing but encouragement.  A really great teacher and inspiration!<br><br>

		<p>My daughter is learning the marimba from him. He is very supportive and 	patient. My daughter needed to learn two pieces for her SOTA (San Francisco 	School of the Arts) audition. He taught her a snare drum and marimba piece. 	He put together a plan and gave her homework to do weekly and she was 	prepared to audition in seven weeks. David knows what he’s doing and is so 	passionate about his students. He even loaned my daughter his special mallets 	for her audition. My daughter was accepted into SOTA and we owe it all to David. 	He is an exceptional teacher. My daughter has taken lessons from other drum 	teacher but David is definitely a true professional.<br><br>

		I've been taking lessons from David for over two years now, and I must say 	that its been great. I started playing drums really late and his focus on technique 	has really helped me adapt to the demands of drumming. Classes are informal 	and he almost always spends more than an hour with you. His taste in music is 	wide and the best part is even after 30 odd years of playing drums, he knows that 	learning is a never ending process. I'm glad to say that David is more than just 	my teacher, but also my friend.<br><br>

		Mr. Dieni has sworn to the 'Percussive Hippocratic Oath'. There is no such thing, 	but if there was, it would describe the ethical code by which David operates his 	educational practice. Believe it or not, there is a "right way to drum", no doubt 	about it. Some percussion teachers never learn that lesson well enough to pass it 	along to their students. I know because I've taken lessons from them. In my 	past, I have been a member of several elite drum corps but over the last 10 	years, as I started my high-tech computer career, I let my chops go but never lost 	my love for drumming. David has personally helped me undo years of neglect 	and bad hand technique. After two years of perseverance in the face of	adversity, I have made unbelievable strides in getting my skills back that I 	would've told you two years ago were totally impossible. I can't say enough about 	David in the capacity he has served as my personal guide from the abyss of bad 	hand technique back to the land of the living drummer. Thanks David, I feel a 	genuine sense of gratitude to you for having guided me back to the activity I 	identify with and love.<br><br>
